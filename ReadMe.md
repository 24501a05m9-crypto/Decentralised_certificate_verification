# 📜 Certificate Verification

## 📝 Project Description

The **Certificate Verification** project is a blockchain-based application designed to authenticate and verify certificates, ensuring their originality and preventing the use of duplicates. By leveraging the immutability and transparency of blockchain technology, this system provides a secure and tamper-proof method of validating certificates issued by authorized entities.
